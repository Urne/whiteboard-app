# Whiteboard
*See also https://wiki.gnome.org/BastianIls%C3%B8/DevX*  
During the period 25th to 29th January 2015 I'll perform a review of the developer experience. The journey starts at [link](http://developer.gnome.org "GNOME Developer Center"). My goal is to create a GTK 3 application in C called "Whiteboard" using Builder. Whiteboard provides a mean to create and browse groups of files, applications, links and images. I will develop on Fedora Rawhide. 

Work is GPL3.
